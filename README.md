# Object-Oriented Programming 2 Project: Tower Defense Game

As part of our Object-Oriented Programming 2 course, we have embarked on an ambitious project to design and implement a Tower Defense game. This initiative is directed by Sir Jay Vince Serato and is a collaborative effort based on team agreements that emphasize the application of core OOP concepts.

## Project Overview: 
Our project is inspired by the strategic and engaging gameplay found in many popular Tower Defense games, which are known for their straightforward mechanisms and rules. By choosing this genre, we aim to develop a comprehensive understanding and practical expertise in several key areas:

**Advanced OOP Concepts:** Ensuring a solid application of object-oriented principles such as inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction.

**Multithreading:** Implementing multithreading to manage the simultaneous execution of complex interactions within the game.

**UI Design:** Crafting intuitive and aesthetically pleasing user interfaces that enhance player interaction and game immersion.

## Objective: 
This project is not just an academic requirement; it is a significant opportunity to deepen our understanding of software development in a real-world context. By tackling this project, we intend to hone our skills in coding, design, and teamwork, thereby preparing us for professional challenges in the field of software engineering.

## Development Tools:
IntelliJ IDEA: All coding, testing, and debugging activities will be conducted in IntelliJ IDEA, an integrated development environment that enhances our productivity with its powerful code assistance, navigation features, and built-in tools and integrations.
JavaFX: We will employ JavaFX as the framework for building the graphical user interface (GUI) of the game. JavaFX provides a rich set of features that allow for the creation of high-quality, responsive GUI applications.
